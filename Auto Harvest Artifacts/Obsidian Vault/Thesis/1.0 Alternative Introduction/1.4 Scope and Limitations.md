**Scope:**

- Implementation of a firmware stack on an ESP-based development board with multiple analog and digital sensors.
    
- Backend system using Express and MongoDB for data storage, communication, and alert processing.
    
- MQTT-based real-time communication with optional WebSocket integration.
    
- User-facing frontend for controller pairing and data display.
    

**Limitations:**

- No OTA (over-the-air) update system included at this stage.
    
- Prototype built on off-the-shelf components and development boards, not custom PCBs.
    
- System supports a single controller device per user for now.
    
- Visualization and notification features are limited in scope and platform support.
