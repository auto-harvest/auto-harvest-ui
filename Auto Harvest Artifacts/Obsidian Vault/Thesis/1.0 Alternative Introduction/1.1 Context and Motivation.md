Hydroponics is an emerging method of cultivation that enables efficient plant growth using nutrient-rich water solutions instead of soil. Its benefits—reduced water consumption, controlled nutrient delivery, and year-round productivity—make it an attractive option for sustainable agriculture, especially in urban and resource-constrained environments.

Despite its promise, hydroponic systems often require precise environmental control and monitoring, typically achieved through expensive commercial controllers or complex DIY setups. These barriers hinder adoption by hobbyists, small growers, and educational institutions.

The motivation behind this project is to create a technically sound, modular, and cost-effective hydroponic monitoring and automation platform that integrates modern embedded systems with cloud services, aiming to bridge the gap between accessibility and performance.
