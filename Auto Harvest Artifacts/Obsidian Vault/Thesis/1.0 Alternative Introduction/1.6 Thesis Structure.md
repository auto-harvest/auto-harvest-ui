This thesis is structured into ten chapters as follows:

- **Chapter 2 – Software:**  
    Presents the software components of the system, including the backend API, embedded firmware, and integration with external services such as MongoDB and ActiveMQ. It also outlines communication mechanisms via MQTT and WebSocket protocols.
    
- **Chapter 3 – Hardware:**  
    Describes the physical hardware involved in the system, including sensors, modules, wiring configurations, and development board usage. Considerations for power, calibration, and maintenance are also discussed.
    
- **Chapter 4 – Material:**  
    Covers the physical assembly of the prototype, including wiring layout, casing design considerations, power distribution, and modularity. Maintenance procedures and sensor replacement logistics are included.
    
- **Chapter 5 – Infrastructure:**  
    Details the cloud infrastructure used to deploy and manage the system. This includes Google Cloud Platform services, Kubernetes clusters, storage solutions, and DNS and security configurations through Cloudflare.
    
- **Chapter 6 – Developer Experience:**  
    Describes the development environment, including version control practices, repository structure, local tooling, and developer workflow.
    
- **Chapter 7 – Continuous Integration and Deployment:**  
    Explains the automation pipeline for deploying both the frontend and backend services. It includes GitHub Actions workflows, containerization, image publishing, and helper scripts for deployment.
    
- **Chapter 8 – Challenges:**  
    Identifies and discusses the main technical and practical challenges encountered during development, including system limitations, design trade-offs, and incomplete or abandoned features.
    
- **Chapter 9 – Roadmap:**  
    Outlines future improvements and development plans. This includes potential production-level enhancements, expansion to other applications, and long-term goals for scalability and industrial viability.
    
- **Chapter 10 – Conclusion:**  
    Summarizes the delivered product, evaluates its functionality, explores alternative applications, reflects on the future of hydroponics, and provides closing insights based on the outcomes of the project.
