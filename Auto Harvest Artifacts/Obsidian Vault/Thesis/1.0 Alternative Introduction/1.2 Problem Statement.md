Most accessible hydroponic automation solutions fall into one of two categories:

- **Commercial systems**, which are costly, closed-source, and not easily customizable.
    
- **DIY solutions**, which often lack integration, scalability, or reliability for continuous operation.
    

There is a need for a system that balances affordability with technical capability, offering modular firmware, cloud connectivity, remote control, and ease of useâ€”all while remaining open for further development and experimentation.
