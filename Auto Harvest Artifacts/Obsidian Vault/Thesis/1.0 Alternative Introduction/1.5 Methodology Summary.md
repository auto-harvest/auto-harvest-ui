The project was executed in multiple phases:

1. **Hardware prototyping:** Using an Arduino-compatible board and off-the-shelf sensors.
    
2. **Firmware development:** C++ implementation using PlatformIO and PubSubClient for MQTT communication.
    
3. **Backend development:** REST and WebSocket API with authentication and cloud data storage.
    
4. **Frontend and pairing UI:** Built with Expo (React Native) and deployed to static Google Buckets.
    
5. **Cloud infrastructure:** Using Google Cloud Platform, Cloudflare, and Kubernetes for deployment and security.
    
6. **CI/CD pipelines:** GitHub Actions and custom scripts for automated deployment and version tracking.
