To ensure a structured and efficient development lifecycle, the Auto Harvest project adopts a **trunk-based Git workflow**, with three primary branches: `dev`, `stage`, and `main`. New features and changes are first developed in isolated branches—named using the convention `feature/issue_name` or `hotfix/issue_name`—and merged into the `dev` branch. Once a collection of stable changes is accumulated, they are promoted to the `stage` branch for validation and testing in a live **Kubernetes cluster**. Upon successful testing, a pull request is created to merge the changes into `main`, finalizing the release pipeline.

Code reviews are mandatory for all pull requests, particularly when transitioning from `stage` to `main`, ensuring quality control and team collaboration. While there is no enforced commit message format, the team follows a practice of writing short, clean, and descriptive commit messages. Commits are generally preserved, although squash merges may be used when a branch contains excessive noise from minor or counter changes.

The project employs **GitHub Actions** to automate backend deployment, where freshly built Docker images are pushed to an artifact repository and later pulled into the Kubernetes cluster. For the mobile frontend, **Expo Application Services (EAS)** is used to generate internal distribution builds—especially after introducing new native libraries—and to produce production-ready APKs. Although **unit and end-to-end testing capabilities** are scaffolded using **NX**, they are not actively utilized in the current development phase. Issue tracking is managed via **GitHub Issues**, although linking issues to commits or PRs is not a standard practice.
