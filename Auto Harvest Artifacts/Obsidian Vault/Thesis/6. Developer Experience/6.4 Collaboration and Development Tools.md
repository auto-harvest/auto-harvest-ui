Throughout the development lifecycle of **Auto Harvest**, several collaboration, development, and deployment tools were employed to enhance productivity, collaboration, and maintainability:

- **GitHub:**  
    Used for effective version control, collaborative coding, and maintaining a structured history of project changes.  
    (Repositories: [auto-harvest-ui](https://github.com/auto-harvest/auto-harvest-ui), [auto-harvest backend](https://github.com/auto-harvest/auto-harvest))
    
- **GitHub Projects:**  
    Kanban-style boards provided clear visualization of workflows, task tracking, and effective issue management throughout the project development.
    
- **Docker:**  
    Containerization technology was utilized for packaging the backend application and its dependencies, ensuring consistent development, testing, and deployment environments, thus simplifying portability and scalability.
    
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP):**  
    Leveraged for hosting the backend infrastructure, database management, and providing robust, secure, and scalable server environments. This allowed seamless integration and reliable access for the mobile application to retrieve real-time sensor data.
    
- **Expo Development Tools:**  
    Simplified cross-platform mobile app development, enabling streamlined builds, testing, and deployments for Android and iOS.
    
- **Visual Studio Code:**  
    The primary IDE used for coding, debugging, testing, and project management tasks related to TypeScript, JavaScript, and React Native development.
    

These combined tools facilitated agile development, continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD), enhanced collaboration, and consistent, efficient project management.
