Transitioning from a development prototype to a production-ready device requires addressing a wide range of **hardware, durability, and usability** factors. While the core firmware and functionality are complete, the embedded system must evolve beyond a breadboard and jumper wire setup.

The following steps outline what needs to be done to prepare the embedded portion of Auto Harvest for field deployment.

### üî≤ Custom PCB Design

Currently, components are connected through a Mega Sensor Shield and breadboard wiring. For production:

- A **custom PCB** must be designed that:
    
    - Integrates the ESP32 or equivalent MCU
        
    - Provides dedicated sockets for each sensor and module (e.g., JST, Molex)
        
    - Includes voltage regulation and level shifting circuitry
        
    - Supports pin protection, fuse isolation, and optional expansion headers
        

This will drastically reduce size, improve reliability, and allow automated manufacturing.

### üß± Durable Casing and Enclosure

The current open-layout setup is suited for demonstrations, but not harsh or humid environments like greenhouses or hydroponic beds. In production:

- A **custom 3D-printed or injection-molded enclosure** must be created that:
    
    - Is **IP-rated** for moisture and dust resistance (e.g., IP65)
        
    - Includes **ventilation** for temperature sensors
        
    - Offers **external ports** for sensor cables and power lines
        
    - Enables **tool-less access** for maintenance or recalibration
        

The casing design should balance ruggedness, ease of assembly, and aesthetic integration into agricultural setups.

### üîå Connectorization and Cable Management

To support sensor/module replacement and hot-swapping:

- All peripherals (sensors, pumps, relays) should connect via **standardized plugs** (e.g., JST, GX12, waterproof IP67 connectors)
    
- Cable routing must be documented and fixed using **strain reliefs** and cable ties
    
- Power and signal cables should be clearly labeled and color-coded
    

This prevents accidental disconnections and simplifies installation in the field.

### üîã Power Management

The development setup uses a fixed 12V adapter. For production:

- Investigate **battery-backed or solar-powered options** for off-grid scenarios
    
- Include **fused input protection** and **buck converters** for multiple voltage rails (e.g., 12V pumps, 5V sensors, 3.3V logic)
    
- Add **brownout detection** and **voltage level monitoring** to prevent erratic behavior during drops

### üîí Hardware Fail-Safe Features

- **Watchdog timers** (software + hardware) to auto-reboot on hangs
    
- **Flow protection** logic to shut down pumps if water is not flowing
    
- Hardware switches or jumper pins to enter **maintenance mode**
    
- Physical **status LEDs** for power, network, and fault indicators
    

These ensure system resilience even without remote connectivity.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Factory Configuration and Flashing

For scalable production, each unit must go through:

- **Initial flashing** of firmware via test jig or USB automation
    
- Storage of **unique identifiers** (e.g., device ID, secret key) in EEPROM
    
- QR code labeling for app-based onboarding (SSID, MAC, model info)
    

Scripts should automate this provisioning process to avoid human error.
