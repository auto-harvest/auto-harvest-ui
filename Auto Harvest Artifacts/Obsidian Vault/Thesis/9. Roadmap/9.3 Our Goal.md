Auto Harvest began as a technically interesting challenge — a chance to combine our background in software engineering with a completely different world: agriculture. But what started as a prototype quickly became a personal mission to explore what happens when **technology meets nature**, and to build something that doesn’t just work — but grows.

Our goal is to create a system that makes **precision agriculture accessible**: a solution that is open, repairable, affordable, and useful not only to engineers but to hobbyists, greenhouse growers, researchers, and schools.

In the process, this project pushed us far outside our comfort zones. As software engineers, we were familiar with APIs, databases, and frontends — but Auto Harvest introduced us to:

- **Embedded systems** and firmware constraints
    
- **Material science and sensor chemistry**
    
- **Electronic circuit safety, flow control, and real-time feedback**
    

It gave us a chance to see the **entire system** end-to-end: from the physical conductivity of nutrient solutions, to the calibration of analog signals, to how data is logged in MongoDB and streamed live through WebSockets. This project gave us a more **holistic engineering view** — beyond just code.

With more resources, we would have chosen **more powerful and efficient hardware**, explored deeper sensing (like **spectrograph-based nutrient analysis**), and allocated full workdays to R&D instead of late-night hours after our day jobs. But that limitation also forced us to be creative — to build something meaningful, from scratch, on our own terms.

Auto Harvest represents the beginning of our contribution to a field that matters: **sustainable, smart agriculture**. We believe this system can scale — from a grow box in someone’s garage to a data-driven greenhouse on an industrial farm. And more importantly, we hope it inspires other engineers to cross boundaries — to see how what they know today can grow into something entirely new.
