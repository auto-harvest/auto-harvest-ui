Several enhancements have been prioritized based on technical feasibility, user experience feedback, and architectural scalability:

- **OTA Firmware Updates**  
    Transitioning from ESP8266 to ESP32 will allow over-the-air updates using secure Wi-Fi, enabling remote bug fixes and new feature rollouts without manual flashing.
    
- **App-Guided Calibration Flow**  
    Instead of performing calibration manually and editing EEPROM values by hand, a mobile interface will guide users through the process, prompting them to insert probes into reference solutions and accepting calibration values in real time.
    
- **Multi-User Environment & Permissions**  
    A role-based system allowing multiple users to manage different devices, including read-only modes, administrator roles, and shared dashboards.
    
- **Push Notifications for Web**  
    Since Expo's push notification system only supports mobile, a web-compatible notification implementation (via Firebase or native browser push APIs) will be developed.
    
- **Combined Graph Viewer**  
    A new telemetry dashboard will allow users to view time-series graphs from multiple sensors simultaneously, enabling correlations (e.g., pH vs. water temp over time).
    
- **Offline Diagnostics Mode**  
    The system will enter a local diagnostic mode when disconnected from Wi-Fi, maintaining logs and issuing visual alerts through the LCD screen until reconnection is restored.
    
- **Modular Firmware Refactor**  
    Although current firmware is well-structured, future iterations will aim for true plug-and-play support with automatic sensor detection and hot-swap capabilities.
    
- **Kubernetes Namespace Segregation**  
    A dedicated `stage` and `prod` namespace will be used in GKE, with fully isolated services and secrets. This allows production deployments to run independently and receive stable updates.
    
- **Persistent Cloud Storage**  
    Production MongoDB and GCS buckets will be backed by GCP's persistent volumes and snapshot tools to avoid data loss and ensure long-term telemetry storage.
    
- **Cloud Monitoring & Alerts**  
    Prometheus (via Google Cloud Monitoring) will be configured with production-grade metrics, alert thresholds, and incident response integration.
    
- **Preloaded Device Configs**  
    New devices will ship with unique identifiers and preconfigured metadata, enabling plug-and-play setup during pairing.
