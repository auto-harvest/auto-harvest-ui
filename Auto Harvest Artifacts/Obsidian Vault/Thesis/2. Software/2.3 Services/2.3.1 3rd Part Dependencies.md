The Auto Harvest system is composed of both custom-built components (firmware, backend, frontend) and several essential **third-party services** that provide runtime infrastructure. These services are managed using **Docker Compose** for local development and provisioned as managed resources in **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** for production.

They serve key roles such as messaging, persistence, and container networking â€” enabling modular, distributed behavior across microcontroller devices and cloud-hosted APIs.
