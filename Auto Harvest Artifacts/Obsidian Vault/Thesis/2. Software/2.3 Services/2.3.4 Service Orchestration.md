In both local and cloud environments, these services are:

- **Networked together** via Docker Compose or Kubernetes Services
    
- Accessed via environment variables (in `.env` files) injected during runtime
    
- Connected to from both the backend and firmware (MQTT over TCP)
    

The local development stack simulates production topology to ensure identical behavior, while in GCP, **load balancing, auto-scaling**, and **firewalling** are managed by Kubernetes and Cloudflare.
