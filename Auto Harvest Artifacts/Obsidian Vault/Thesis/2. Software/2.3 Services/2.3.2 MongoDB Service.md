**MongoDB** is used for document-based storage of:

- Sensor logs
    
- Device metadata (controller config, pairing status)
    
- User accounts and credentials (hashed with bcrypt)
    
- Notification tokens (Expo push)
    

It offers flexibility in data modeling and high-speed queries across time-stamped telemetry records.

services:
  mongo:
    image: mongo
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"
    volumes:
      - mongo_data:/data/db
    environment:
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME: devtest
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD: devtest

volumes:
  mongo_data:

This local configuration supports:

- Persistent local database (`mongo_data`)
    
- Dev-only access credentials (`devtest`)
    
- Zero-config access from the backend via `mongodb://localhost:27017`
    

#### ðŸ“¦ In Production (GCP)

In production, MongoDB is deployed as a **self-hosted container inside GKE**, not as a managed GCP service (e.g., Atlas or Cloud Mongo). This allows for:

- Full control over resource allocation
    
- Easier volume management and backup via Kubernetes PVCs
    
- Lower cost compared to hosted alternatives (for this stage)
