The Dashboard Overview (also known as the Controller Selection Screen) is the first screen that appears after a successful login. It acts as the main hub where users can view and manage all of their connected hydroponic systems, referred to as **controllers**.

Each controller is displayed as a card that provides the following information:

1. The system’s name (entered during the "Add Controller" process)
2. The number of plants the system manages
3. The physical location of the system

In addition to this dynamic list, the dashboard features:

- A **search bar** that filters the list based on the controller name using client-side search. This improves usability, especially in large-scale infrastructures.
    
- An **"Add New System"** button at the bottom of the screen, which starts the process of pairing a new controller to the user’s profile.

#### **Design and UX Considerations**

The dashboard follows a **minimalist design** that only shows essential information, helping users focus on what matters. Each action button includes a clear icon, making navigation more intuitive. The color theme centers around shades of green, reinforcing the app’s **eco-friendly identity** and aligning with its agricultural purpose.

#### **Navigation Role**

This screen is the **main navigational anchor** of the app. From here, users can go to other screens such as insights, notifications, or controller settings. It is also accessible through the Profile screen, which includes a "Back to Controller Selection" button. This allows users to return here at any time, making it a reliable fallback for navigation issues.

The Dashboard Overview reflects the heart of the Auto Harvest system—**monitoring and expanding** personalized hydroponic networks with minimal effort and a user-friendly approach.
