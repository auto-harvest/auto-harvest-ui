The User Interface (UI) repository of the Auto Harvest Hydroponics IoT Project serves as the interactive and visual front-end of this advanced agricultural system. Within the scope of our Bachelor's thesis, this section specifically focuses on the user interface component housed in its dedicated repository. This UI serves as the primary interaction layer between the complex backend processes, microprocessor data streams, and the end-users, offering a user-friendly platform to efficiently manage and optimize hydroponic farming operations.

The user interface repository employs modern frameworks and design methodologies to deliver a highly responsive, intuitive, and interactive application. The repository's primary purpose is to ensure seamless integration with backend services while providing a visually appealing and accessible user experience.

The main objective of the projectâ€™s User Interface is to provide tools to its users so that they can manage and review their systems, even on an organization level infrastructure.

### Significance and Context

As agriculture increasingly moves towards digitization and IoT integration, user interfaces play a critical role in ensuring technologies remain accessible to a broad range of users. The Auto Harvest UI repository addresses this need explicitly by simplifying complex processes into easily manageable interactions. This facilitates greater user engagement and significantly reduces the barrier to entry for users less familiar with advanced technological interfaces.

### Objectives

The primary objectives of the UI repository within this project include:
- Providing an intuitive and easily navigable interface to accommodate both novice and experienced users.
- Supporting continuous real-time monitoring of critical hydroponic parameters, enhancing user decision-making capabilities.
- Enabling efficient interaction between users and their hydroponic setups, allowing immediate response to environmental changes and system alerts.

### Scope of UI Analysis

In this thesis, I will explore and analyze specific aspects of the Auto Harvest UI repository to understand better how it effectively supports hydroponic management:
- Investigating the technical architecture to identify strengths and areas for improvement within the current UI framework.
- Documenting and reflecting on development processes and methodologies, including the effectiveness of agile practices implemented during the project.
- Presenting visual analyses through annotated screenshots to clearly illustrate user interactions, workflow, and navigation paths.
- Evaluating the responsiveness of the UI across different devices and examining strategies used to optimize overall performance.
- Providing relevant examples of implemented code, particularly focusing on critical functionalities that integrate user interactions with backend data processing.

Through this detailed approach, the analysis aims to clarify the UI's practical contributions and potential enhancements within the Auto Harvest Hydroponics IoT Project.
