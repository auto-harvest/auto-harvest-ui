The development of the Auto Harvest Hydroponics UI repository leverages a selection of modern, robust technologies designed to facilitate both rapid development and long-term scalability. Key technologies adopted include:

## Expo Framework

Expo is utilized due to its efficiency in cross-platform mobile app development. By simplifying the build processes and providing extensive tooling, Expo accelerates development cycles and supports quick prototyping. A significant advantage is its capability for Over-The-Air (OTA) updates, which allows the deployment of improvements directly to users without needing manual updates from app stores. This approach significantly enhances the agility of the project's development process.

## React Navigation (Expo Router)

React Navigation, particularly Expo Router, is central to managing complex navigation and routing within the application. This technology ensures that users can intuitively navigate through various screens and functionalities. Expo Router's support for deep linking enhances user experience by providing direct access to specific parts of the application via URLs, facilitating smoother user interactions and improving the overall accessibility of the app.

## Redux Toolkit and Redux Persist

For robust state management, Redux Toolkit has been integrated into the application, offering a simplified yet powerful approach to managing state across different components. Redux Persist further complements this capability by allowing the persistence of state data across sessions. This ensures continuity of user interactions and preferences, significantly enhancing user satisfaction and system reliability.

## React Native Paper and React Native Chart Kit

The integration of React Native Paper brings consistency and adherence to Material Design principles throughout the UI components. It ensures a cohesive visual design and accessibility. React Native Chart Kit complements this by providing visually appealing and clear data visualization tools. It helps users interpret real-time hydroponic data quickly and efficiently, playing a critical role in enabling effective decision-making based on accurate and easily digestible information.

This document provides a foundational understanding of the technological decisions and their specific contributions to the successful implementation of the UI within the Auto Harvest Hydroponics IoT Project.
