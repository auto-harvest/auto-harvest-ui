Testing and debugging in embedded systems require careful planning due to constraints like limited memory, real-time execution, and hardware availability. The Auto Harvest firmware was built and validated using a combination of **manual hardware testing**, **serial logging**, **simulated command dispatch**, and **interface inspection** through MQTT clients.

### üîå Live Serial Logging

PlatformIO provides integrated serial monitor support, which was used throughout development to:

- Confirm successful Wi-Fi connections or fallbacks to AP mode
    
- Observe real-time sensor values (e.g., temperature, TDS, pH)
    
- Trace the MQTT publish/subscribe flow
    
- Log module activations (e.g., pump on/off, LCD update cycles)
    

Each service and component prints state transitions, debug info, and telemetry to the serial port using `Serial.println()`. These logs form the primary source of runtime visibility.

### üì° MQTT Command Testing

To validate MQTT behavior, commands were manually published using tools like **MQTT Explorer**, or command-line clients to simulate cloud-originated instructions. This allowed verification of:

- Subscription and message reception
    
- JSON command parsing
    
- Relay/module state changes in response to topics like `pump-on`, `connect-to-wifi`, `lcd-off`
    

Each command is routed through the message queue and printed as it is received and executed.

### üåê AP Mode & HTTP Testing

Pairing mode (Wi-Fi Access Point) was tested using:

- Postman and browser requests to simulate device configuration
    
- Manual connection to `ESP8266` SSID and submission of credentials via a simple web UI form
    
- Inspection of EEPROM write/read routines via log feedback after POST handling
    

This ensured that device configuration and persistence mechanisms worked reliably in real-world pairing scenarios.

### üìà Sensor Verification

Sensor readings were tested against:

- Commercial digital thermometers and weather stations (DHT11, DS18B20)
    
- pH strips and calibration fluids (pH probe)
    
- Conductivity meter (TDS sensor)
    
- Manual water level tests (low, high) and flow sensor pulse readings
    

Values were verified for range, accuracy, and jitter, with noisy sensors (like TDS or pH) being smoothed via software averaging. Critical edge cases (e.g., pump active with zero flow) were tested both by simulating conditions and physically disrupting flow.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Development Practices

- Code was kept modular and testable by isolating hardware logic into services and modules
    
- Debug-specific timers and variables (e.g., polling intervals, watchdog resets) were exposed through MQTT to allow runtime testing
    
- EEPROM values were periodically dumped to ensure correct persistence behavior between reboots

This practical, test-driven approach helped validate core functionality early and frequently, laying the foundation for reliable operation even in resource-constrained environments.
