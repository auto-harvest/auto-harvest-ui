The firmware for the Auto Harvest system is developed using **PlatformIO**, a modern ecosystem and build system designed for embedded software. PlatformIO replaces the traditional Arduino IDE with a more robust, version-controlled, and scalable workflow that integrates seamlessly with **VS Code**, **unit testing**, and **multi-board support**.

### ‚úÖ Why PlatformIO?

PlatformIO offers several critical advantages over traditional Arduino workflows:

- **Per-project dependency management** using `platformio.ini`
    
- **Intelligent IntelliSense and LSP integration** for C++ code
    
- **Faster builds** and **incremental compilation**
    
- **Source folder structure support**, enabling a clean modular architecture (`src/`, `lib/`, `include/`, `test/`)
    
- Built-in support for **multiple environments** (e.g., different boards, test configs)
    
- Easy integration with serial monitors, OTA uploaders, and debugging tools

### ‚öôÔ∏è `platformio.ini` Configuration

The `platformio.ini` file defines:

- **Board**: ESP8266 or ESP01 module
    
- **Framework**: Arduino core for ESP8266
    
- **Libraries**: Automatically pulled from the PlatformIO registry (e.g., `PubSubClient`, `OneWire`, `DHT`)

### üß™ Debug and Upload Tools

- Serial output is routed through PlatformIO‚Äôs integrated monitor (`pio device monitor`)
    
- The project is debug-ready with defined timers, macros, and `Serial.print` statements
    
- Firmware is typically uploaded via USB, but can be adapted for OTA once migrated to ESP32
