The firmware relies on a set of well-established, open-source libraries that provide low-level sensor support, communication protocols, hardware interfacing, and memory access. These libraries are managed via **PlatformIOâ€™s dependency manager**, ensuring deterministic builds and reproducible environments.

Each library was chosen for **reliability, active maintenance, and compatibility with ESP8266/ESP32 boards**.

### ðŸ“¡ Communication

| Library                      | Purpose                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **PubSubClient**             | MQTT client for communicating with ActiveMQ. Supports secure connections, QoS, retained messages, and custom callbacks for dynamic topics. |
| **ESP8266WiFi**              | Manages Wi-Fi client and AP modes. Includes scanning, connection logic, and signal status.                                                 |
| **ESPAsyncTCP** _(optional)_ | Used in some builds for async TCP features or optimized MQTT reconnecting.                                                                 |

### ðŸ’¾ Storage

|Library|Purpose|
|---|---|
|**EEPROM**|Reads and writes persistent key-value data (e.g., SSID, password, MQTT config, calibration data). Wrapped by `DiskManagerService`.|

### ðŸ§ª Sensors and Hardware

| Library                | Purpose                                                                                       |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **OneWire**            | Required for DS18B20 (water temperature sensor)                                               |
| **DallasTemperature**  | High-level driver for DS18B20 sensor                                                          |
| **DHT sensor library** | Reads DHT11 sensor for humidity and air temp                                                  |
| _(Custom Drivers)_     | pH, TDS, water level, and flow sensor logic are implemented manually or using open datasheets |

---

### ðŸ§  Utilities and Timing

|Library|Purpose|
|---|---|
|**ArduinoJson** _(optional)_|Serializes/deserializes JSON payloads for MQTT|
|**map<string, double>**|Standard C++ STL used with custom wrappers (`MapWrapper`) for sensor data exchange|
|**Custom Timer Class**|Non-blocking `expired()` system used for polling and loop scheduling|

---

### ðŸ–¥ Display

|Library|Purpose|
|---|---|
|**LiquidCrystal_I2C**|Controls the 1602 LCD screen via I2C, used for rotating display content and messages|

---

### ðŸ’¡ Development Tooling

|Tool / Technique|Purpose|
|---|---|
|**Serial Monitor (PlatformIO)**|Real-time logs during development for sensor reads, Wi-Fi states, MQTT events|
|**Manual Command Injection**|MQTT tools (e.g., MQTT Explorer, custom CLI) used to send `pump-on`, `scan-networks`, etc.|
|**Postman or Curl**|Sends HTTP pairing requests to the embedded web server during AP mode|
|**VS Code Debug Config**|Enables breakpoint-based debugging and timed variable inspection|

All libraries are kept lightweight to fit within **ESP8266 memory constraints**, and modular enough to allow transition to **ESP32**, where additional memory and performance will enable more complex libraries like OTA or filesystem-based logging (e.g., `LittleFS` or `SPIFFS`).
