Debugging is supported both during development and in production-like environments:

#### ðŸ›  Development Tools

- **VSCode Debugging (`launch.json`)**  
    Supports live debugging using `ts-node`, mapped source paths, custom ports, and dev-specific environment overrides.
    
- **Manual Testing**
    
    - **Postman** is used to validate all HTTP endpoints
        
    - MQTT behavior is validated via published/subscribed test messages
        
    - Real-time behavior debugged via `socket.io` debug logs and browser devtools
        

#### ðŸ”„ Simulated Sensor Streams

- `faker.js` is used to generate fake sensor logs (temperature, humidity, etc.)
    
- Interval-based simulations publish messages to test backend ingestion, alert logic, and push flow
    
- These mocks allow frontend teams to develop and test independently of real hardware
    

#### ðŸ“Š Profiling & Logging

- **Lighthouse and Chrome DevTools** help monitor response latency and frontend-backend integration
    
- Logs are streamed to standard output and parsed via `kubectl logs` in the GKE environment
    
- Plans are in place to centralize logs via **GCP Logging** or a future **Grafana/Prometheus** stack
