The Auto Harvest system relies on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** to deploy and manage its core infrastructure. As a centralized, scalable, and cost-efficient solution, GCP provides the backbone for backend hosting, frontend distribution, and cloud-native orchestration of services.

#### üß† Services in Use

We actively use a subset of GCP‚Äôs core services for managing our infrastructure:

- **Kubernetes Engine**: Hosts all production workloads, including the Express.js backend server, MongoDB, and the ActiveMQ messaging broker.
    
- **Cloud Storage**: Used for serving static frontend files. These files are built and copied into a bucket, allowing React assets to be hosted cost-effectively.
    
- **Artifact Registry**: Stores container images used for Kubernetes deployments.
    
- **IAM & Admin**: Manages access control across the cluster and services. We use GitHub Actions with a dedicated service account (Cluster Owner, Bucket Owner) for automation.
    
- **Network Services & VPC**: Provide internal and external routing between services, enable secure connectivity, and control IP ranges for load balancers and internal services.
    
- **Billing**: Monitored via budget alerts, taking advantage of the initial $300 GCP free credit. We use the **Autopilot cluster billing mode** to reduce operational costs.
    
- **Cloud Monitoring**: Integrated for observability; logs and metrics are collected via GCP‚Äôs Prometheus-managed instance to track system health.
    

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Deployment Workflow

The deployment process is handled by a custom script that automates container builds and applies Kubernetes manifests. The GitHub Actions workflow also leverages a GCP service account to securely deploy new builds to the GKE cluster.

A production Kubernetes environment is currently live on GCP. A separate staging environment is run locally using a lightweight Kubernetes distribution. This separation allows rapid prototyping and safe deployment practices before releasing to production.

#### üîí Access and Security

Administrative access to GCP resources is granted through individual user accounts. The GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow is granted access via a dedicated service account with tightly scoped permissions.

#### üåê Connectivity and Hosting

Firmware modules do not communicate with GCP directly; instead, they interact with a self-hosted ActiveMQ broker within the Kubernetes cluster. From there, backend services handle message processing and database storage. This design keeps external exposure minimal and centralizes logic within a secure cluster environment.
