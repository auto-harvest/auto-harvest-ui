Beyond security and routing, Cloudflare plays a key role in ensuring that Auto Harvest is **fast, accessible, and discoverable** on the web. Performance tuning and SEO integration are critical to improving user experience and ensuring proper indexing by search engines.

#### ðŸš€ Frontend Performance

Static files served from Google Cloud Storage buckets are cached at both:

- **Cloudflareâ€™s global edge CDN**, and
    
- **Google Cloudâ€™s regional CDN layer**
    

This dual-caching approach allows:

- Reduced load times
    
- Faster Time-To-First-Byte (TTFB)
    
- Improved Core Web Vitals for SEO ranking
    

Frontend builds are **minified, hashed, and compressed** via Reactâ€™s production build process, and hosted with headers optimized for:

- `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000` (for hashed assets)
    
- Selective bypass using the custom `no-cache-baby` header during development
    

#### ðŸ”Ž SEO Optimization

To ensure proper indexing and discoverability:

- **Googlebot and other trusted crawlers are explicitly allowed** via Cloudflare Bot Management
    
- A **`robots.txt`** file is served from the bucket, specifying crawlable paths
    
- Proper **`canonical` tags** are injected in HTML templates to prevent duplicate indexing
    
- Meta information (title, description, OpenGraph) is pre-configured for each major route in the frontend
    

Cloudflare caching does not interfere with SEO crawlers, thanks to:

- Respect for HTTP `Vary` headers
    
- Zero reliance on dynamic SSR (Server-Side Rendering) which could delay or block indexing
    

#### ðŸ“Š Analytics and Tuning

We monitor SEO and frontend performance via:

- **Google Search Console** (for index coverage and crawling errors)
    
- **Cloudflare analytics** (for traffic and latency patterns)
    
- **Lighthouse audits** (to optimize asset sizes, reduce unused CSS, and boost performance scores)
