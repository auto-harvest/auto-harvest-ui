Cloudflare plays a central role in the Auto Harvest infrastructure by acting as a **security perimeter, performance accelerator, and intelligent traffic router**. It is positioned as the first point of contact for all external requests, sitting in front of both the API services and frontend hosting buckets.

The integration of Cloudflare enables:

- Global traffic distribution via their Anycast CDN
    
- Attack surface reduction (WAF, bot management)
    
- Smart routing and caching strategies
    
- Simplified SSL/TLS management
    

#### üß∞ Services in Active Use

The following Cloudflare features are actively used in our deployment:

- **DNS Management**  
    Cloudflare manages all DNS records for `autoharvest.solutions`, enabling fast propagation, flexible record control, and integration with subdomain-specific logic (covered in 5.2.2).
    
- **Proxy & CDN Layer**  
    All A and CNAME records for public services are proxied through Cloudflare (orange-cloud enabled), which masks GCP IPs and leverages **Cloudflare's global CDN** to cache and serve content faster, especially for static files.
    
- **Full SSL with Origin Verification**  
    TLS termination occurs at Cloudflare using **Full SSL (Strict)** mode, where Cloudflare validates the origin server using a custom certificate installed in GCP. This ensures encrypted communication end-to-end, and mitigates man-in-the-middle or spoofing attacks.
    
- **WAF (Web Application Firewall)**  
    Rules are defined to filter traffic based on patterns (e.g., known malicious user agents, suspicious paths like `wp-config.php`, `.env`, etc.). This is detailed in Section 5.2.3.
    
- **Reverse Proxy and Rewrites**  
    Custom routing logic and header rewrites support **single-page application (SPA) behavior**, ensuring React Router functions as expected (details in 5.2.4).
    
- **Rate Limiting & Challenge Pages**  
    Cloudflare mitigates abusive traffic through challenge modes and request caps. The ‚ÄúI'm Under Attack‚Äù mode can be toggled to enable site-wide CAPTCHA protection during suspected DDoS activity (see 5.2.6).
    
- **Caching & Performance Optimization**  
    Advanced caching controls are used to reduce bucket load. Custom headers like `"no-cache-baby"` are used to bypass caching when needed. These optimizations are detailed in Section 5.2.7.
