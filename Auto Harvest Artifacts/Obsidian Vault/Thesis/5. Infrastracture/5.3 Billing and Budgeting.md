Cloud infrastructure costs can scale quickly without proper monitoring and controls. In the Auto Harvest project, careful budgeting and cost visibility were essential due to the limited nature of academic and prototype funding. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) provides a flexible billing system and resource configurations that allowed us to balance performance with affordability.

#### üí≥ Free Tier and Startup Credits

The project was initially bootstrapped using the **$300 GCP free credit**, which provided enough resources for:

- Creating and maintaining a **regional Autopilot Kubernetes cluster**
    
- Hosting static files in **Cloud Storage**
    
- Using **Load Balancers** for API and broker exposure
    
- Leveraging **Cloud Monitoring** and **Artifact Registry**
    

The Autopilot mode was deliberately chosen for Kubernetes because it allowed us to **only pay for used resources**, avoiding costs associated with idle node pools.

#### üìä Cost Visibility and Alerts

To prevent overspending, we configured:

- **Budget alerts** in the Google Cloud Console
    
- Thresholds at 50%, 80%, and 100% of projected usage
    
- Weekly cost breakdown emails to monitor any spikes
    

These tools allowed us to scale gradually, identify unusually expensive services, and reduce unnecessary resource consumption.

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Cost-Conscious Infrastructure Design

Key architectural decisions were made with cost in mind:

- **Separate buckets for stage and production**, enabling us to reduce duplication and testing overhead
    
- Using **Cloudflare‚Äôs free tier** for DNS, proxying, and security to offload bandwidth and minimize egress costs
    
- Avoiding GCP-native DBaaS (like Cloud SQL) in favor of a **self-hosted MongoDB instance** inside Kubernetes using Persistent Volumes
    
- Minimal use of premium services unless justified by performance or functionality
    

#### üß™ Local Development and Staging

To reduce cloud resource usage during development:

- Staging deployments are often run on **local Kubernetes clusters**
    
- Only stable builds are promoted to the **production GKE cluster**, minimizing active pods and network egress
