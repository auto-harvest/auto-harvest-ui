The delivered prototype of Auto Harvest is a **fully functional, end-to-end IoT system** capable of monitoring and managing a hydroponic environment through a combination of **hardware sensors**, **embedded firmware**, **cloud infrastructure**, and a **mobile/web application**.

This system was designed, built, and deployed entirely by the project team — from breadboard wiring and low-level embedded code, to cloud deployment pipelines and real-time dashboards.

### 🛠 What’s Still Manual or Incomplete

While the system is robust for a prototype, a few aspects remain non-production:

- Firmware updates require USB flashing (OTA not yet implemented)
    
- Web push notifications are not supported
    
- No combined sensor graphing UI is available on mobile
    
- The casing and PCB are still in a conceptual phase
    
- No cloud-scale monitoring (e.g., Prometheus or metrics dashboard)

Despite these limitations, the system delivers on its original promise: a **scalable foundation for smart hydroponics**, with a clear upgrade path and architectural soundness. It is both a **functional engineering achievement** and a **platform for future expansion**.
