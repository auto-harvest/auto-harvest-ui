## ✅ Test Run Preparation – Key Notes

---

### 🧪 1. **Set Clear Objectives**

Define what you're testing. Examples:

- Can the firmware successfully connect, read sensors, and send data?
    
- Can you issue a remote command (e.g., turn on the pump) and see a physical response?
    
- Can sensor readings be retrieved and visualized in real time (e.g., LCD, backend log, MQTT log)?
    

📌 **Tip**: Make a short checklist (5–10 items) of what “working” looks like for your test.

---

### 📦 2. **Check All Connections**

- Double-check sensor and relay wiring
    
- Secure your power supply
    
- Confirm all modules initialize correctly on boot
    

📌 **Tip**: Run a dry test with `Serial.print()` enabled and verify all modules are logging their `initialize()` status before proceeding.

---

### 🌐 3. **Network & MQTT Sanity Checks**

- Ensure the device is in Wi-Fi **client mode**
    
- Use MQTT Explorer or similar to:
    
    - Confirm device is **connected to broker**
        
    - Subscribe to expected topics (`sensor-log`, `pump-on`, etc.)
        
    - See logs published from the firmware every 5 seconds (or your configured interval)
        

📌 **Tip**: Have logs open from both the device and the backend.

---

### 🔧 4. **Trigger Commands**

From the mobile app or MQTT Explorer:

- Send `pump-on`, `air-pump-off`, `lcd-off`, etc.
    
- Confirm the correct relays toggle
    
- Watch the LCD update or dim accordingly
    

📌 **Tip**: If possible, record the relay click (audible) and the pump starting (visible)

### 📊 5. **Simulate Sensor Conditions**

- Manually trigger water level sensors (dip them in/out of water)
    
- Block the flow sensor while the pump is running (simulate no-flow error)
    
- Check if:
    
    - The pump turns off automatically
        
    - A warning is printed on serial / LCD / MQTT
        
    - Backend receives the anomaly and responds
        

📌 **Tip**: This validates your **fault logic** — a major win for thesis value.

### 📋 6. **Log All Results**

- Take notes of what works and what doesn’t
    
- Record any errors or unexpected behavior
    
- Capture:
    
    - Serial log output
        
    - Screenshots of MQTT traffic or backend console
        
    - Physical photos or video of the device in action
        

---

### 🧪 7. **Optional but Great**

- Try disconnecting Wi-Fi to test **fallback mode**
    
- Power-cycle the device and confirm it **persists its configuration**
    
- Unplug a sensor and watch how the firmware handles a missing device

### 📦 Prepare for Your Thesis Report:

You’ll want to describe:

- The test setup (diagram or photo)
    
- The objectives (what you were validating)
    
- The procedure (step-by-step what you did)
    
- The results (what worked, what failed)
    
- A short analysis (why did it work, and what would you fix?)
