The Auto Harvest project was an opportunity to explore how embedded systems, cloud infrastructure, and mobile interfaces could be integrated into a single, functional IoT application. Hydroponics was chosen as the target use case due to its growing relevance in sustainable agriculture and its interesting overlap between environmental monitoring, automation, and real-time control.

Although our academic background lies primarily in software engineering, this project allowed us to gain hands-on experience in a wider range of technical domains, including:

- Embedded firmware development
    
- Circuit assembly and power safety
    
- Sensor calibration and analog data acquisition
    
- Real-time networking and backend system design
    

The project also required us to engage with hardware limitations, debugging constraints, and physical deployment issues â€” aspects not typically encountered in purely software-based work.

Our long-term interest is to build systems that are **practical, maintainable, and accessible**. While this prototype was designed for hydroponic use, its architecture is adaptable to other forms of smart farming or environmental monitoring. The skills and insights gained through this work form a strong foundation for future development in similar fields.
