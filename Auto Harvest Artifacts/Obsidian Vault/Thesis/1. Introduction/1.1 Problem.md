Traditional agricultural methods are increasingly challenging due to the ongoing impacts of climate change and the rising frequency of natural disasters. Conventional farming practices typically consume substantial amounts of water, heavily rely on favorable and predictable weather conditions, and demand extensive human labor. Additionally, soil-based agriculture frequently encounters issues such as soil degradation, pest infestations, disease outbreaks, and unpredictable productivity cycles, all of which significantly reduce efficiency and diminish crop yields (Savvas & Gruda, 2018).

Hydroponic systems have emerged as a promising solution to these challenges by eliminating the dependency on soil and conserving water through the use of nutrient-rich aqueous solutions. However, traditional hydroponic systems that lack advanced technological integration continue to present notable shortcomings:

- Manual monitoring of these systems is highly time-consuming and labor-intensive. Individuals responsible for maintaining hydroponic setups must continuously collect and analyze system readings, making it challenging to promptly detect changes or issues such as debris clogging pipes or unexpected water overflows.
    
- Manual data collection inherently carries a higher risk of human error. For instance, when manually checking the solution's pH levels using test strips, individuals might inadvertently contaminate the test paper, leading to incorrect readings. Furthermore, if adjustments to the nutrient solution are based solely on a single or limited set of readings, it may lead to misjudgments about the system's health and overlook subtle yet crucial changes.
    
- Delayed detection of issues or alterations within the hydroponic system can have detrimental effects on plant health. For example, excessive supplementation of a particular nutrient can quickly result in plant toxicity, but such problems might only become apparent once visible damage occurs. Similarly, unnoticed issues such as inadequate water levels in reservoirs could disrupt water flow, adversely affecting plant growth before manual inspection identifies the problem.
    
- Additionally, reliance on manual processes restricts the scalability and efficiency of hydroponic systems, making them unsuitable or inefficient for larger agricultural operations or commercial ventures where precision and speed are critical.

Thus, despite their inherent advantages over conventional farming, traditional hydroponic systems continue to struggle with significant limitations in efficiency, accuracy, and scalability. These challenges underscore the necessity for automation, real-time monitoring, and advanced technological integration to fully realize the potential of hydroponic agriculture (Savvas & Gruda, 2018).
