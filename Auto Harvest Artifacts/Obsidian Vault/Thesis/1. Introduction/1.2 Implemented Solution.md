Our proposed solution, named "Auto Harvest," is an advanced automated hydroponic system that employs smart IoT sensors to continuously retrieve real-time data. This system effectively addresses the limitations of traditional hydroponic setups by automating the monitoring and management processes, significantly enhancing accuracy and efficiency. Users are immediately alerted through notifications whenever the system detects anomalies or potential issues, such as fluctuations in nutrient levels, water flow disruptions, or sensor malfunctions, allowing rapid intervention and resolution.

The implemented Auto Harvest system also emphasizes ease of maintenance and user-friendly operation. Users can seamlessly integrate multiple controllers into a single cohesive application, ensuring comprehensive management and oversight from one centralized platform. This unified approach provides substantial security, convenience, and peace of mind by simplifying complex monitoring and control tasks. With Auto Harvestâ€™s innovative technology, users can effortlessly activate or deactivate individual systems with the simple press of a button, access detailed metrics and analytics for each controller at any given moment, and monitor real-time hydroponic environmental conditions through Arduino-based sensors.

Additionally, the Auto Harvest system's capability for detailed real-time data visualization ensures continuous tracking of all critical parameters, helping users make informed, precise adjustments and improvements. Historical and statistical data are readily accessible, allowing users to perform thorough analyses and optimize their hydroponic setups for maximum productivity and efficiency. By integrating cutting-edge IoT technology with user-friendly design, Auto Harvest significantly elevates hydroponic agriculture, making it viable, scalable, and highly effective for both personal and commercial agricultural operations.
