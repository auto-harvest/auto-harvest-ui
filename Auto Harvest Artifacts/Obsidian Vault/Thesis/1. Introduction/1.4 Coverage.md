In alignment with the project's primary goals, significant milestones have been successfully reached. We've achieved comprehensive integration of sensors, including effective calibration and robust validation methods facilitated by both third-party and custom-developed libraries. Our self-created libraries specifically address unique project requirements, optimizing performance and accuracy. Additionally, seamless IoT integration has been established through the Arduino platform, ensuring efficient data capture and reliable communication within the hydroponics system. Furthermore, a user-friendly mobile application built with React Native and Expo has been developed, providing intuitive tools to monitor real-time system status, dynamically add or manage controllers, and promptly receive alerts and notifications. Redux has been effectively utilized for sophisticated state management, ensuring consistent, reliable application performance and data flow. Complementing the mobile solution, we also implemented data visualization capabilities in our dedicated web application, allowing users to effortlessly track trends and performance metrics through interactive and insightful graphical representations. These combined achievements represent significant progress toward complete hydroponic system automation and management, delivering meaningful, accessible insights to the user.
