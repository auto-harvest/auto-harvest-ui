The primary goal of this project is to fully automate hydroponic systems by streamlining processes related to sensor data collection, real-time system monitoring, and comprehensive system management. By leveraging advanced IoT technologies, such as wireless sensors, real-time data visualization, predictive analytics, and intuitive mobile and web interfaces, the project seeks to significantly reduce manual intervention. This reduction aims to minimize human error, increase operational efficiency, and ensure that all collected data remains accurate, valid, and secure. Automating hydroponic systems will not only simplify management for users but also improve resource efficiency, increase crop yield, and promote sustainability. By addressing challenges such as food security, urban agriculture constraints, and environmental impacts, the project positions itself as an innovative solution supporting the future of sustainable agriculture.
