The Auto Harvest system is supported by several auxiliary modules that enable **connectivity, user feedback, and configuration persistence**. These modules complement the sensor and control stack by providing interfaces for communication, display, and memory storage â€” all essential for a robust IoT setup.

#### ðŸ“¡ ESP8266 (ESP-01) â€“ Wi-Fi Communication Bridge

The ESP-01 module acts as a **serially controlled Wi-Fi adapter**, handling all wireless connectivity for the Arduino Mega. It operates strictly as a **slave device**, forwarding commands and data to/from the Arduino, without executing any logic of its own.

Its key roles include:

- **Normal Mode**: Connects to a stored Wi-Fi network, enabling cloud communication via MQTT.
    
- **Factory Mode (Access Point)**: If no valid credentials are stored, the ESP enters **Access Point mode** and spins up a **minimal web server**. The Expo Go mobile app discovers this AP and sends the SSID/password securely to the ESP.
    

Notably, the ESP-01 can operate in **dual-mode** â€” it maintains AP mode for pairing while simultaneously listening for STA reconnection, eliminating the need for manual resets between modes.

âœ… **Production Note**: In future versions, the ESP-01 will be replaced by an **ESP32**, which will unify control logic and connectivity in a single chip, reducing component count and complexity.

#### ðŸ“Ÿ 1602 I2C LCD â€“ Local Display Feedback

A basic **16Ã—2 character LCD** with I2C backpack provides minimal local display for real-time feedback during operation and testing. The screen is used for:

- Displaying air and water temperatures, and humidity
    
- Showing error messages during failure states or debug mode
    
- Manual testing feedback (e.g., float switches or flow sensor response)
    

The display updates every **2 seconds** with fresh data, and current behavior uses **direct write**, meaning new content immediately replaces old output (no queue or scroll).

While basic, this module is ideal for **offline or field use**, providing immediate feedback even when cloud access or mobile app control is unavailable.

#### ðŸ’¾ EEPROM â€“ Configuration Persistence

The Arduino's onboard EEPROM is used to store **device configuration parameters** that must persist across power cycles. These include:

- SSID and password for Wi-Fi
    
- MQTT broker address
    

This allows the device to **automatically reconnect** to both network and backend services on reboot, without requiring the user to reconfigure anything manually.

#### ðŸ“¦ SD Card Reader â€“ Reserved for Logging

The MEGA Sensor Shield includes an onboard **SD card slot**, which is currently **not active in this prototype**, but is reserved for:

- Local data logging (e.g., time-stamped sensor values)
    
- Redundant storage during network outages
    
- Manual data recovery in isolated deployments

#### ðŸ”’ Stability and Power Behavior

All modules were tested together under full runtime load. After initial debugging:

- No **I2C collisions**, **serial conflicts**, or **power draw issues** were observed
    
- Timing-sensitive modules like the ESP-01 and flow sensor were prioritized in the firmware loop
    
- No watchdog timers or soft resets have been implemented yet, but may be added for long-term reliability

This modular structure enables a **clear separation of concerns** and keeps the system flexible for both prototyping and production-scale deployments. Future iterations aim to **condense** this setup into fewer, more capable components â€” namely, an ESP32-based PCB with built-in sensors and display header.
