**Introduction** The Nutrient Film Technique (NFT) hydroponics system described herein was carefully constructed and assembled to facilitate the growth of plants in a controlled, soilless environment. This system includes several key components: a reservoir, pump, hoses, plant tray (tube), and net cups. Each component was selected based on specific criteria to ensure optimal plant health, ease of maintenance, and system efficiency.

**System Components and Construction**

**1. Reservoir** The reservoir serves as the primary storage tank for the nutrient solution. It is designed to be large enough to hold an adequate volume of nutrient-rich water, reducing the frequency of replenishment. A reservoir of approximately {{volume}} liters capacity made from {{material type}} by {{brand}} was chosen for its durability and chemical inertness. The reservoir was positioned strategically below the plant tray to facilitate gravity-assisted nutrient return flow.

**2. Pump** The selected pump, a submersible type manufactured by {{brand}}, model {{model type}}, was utilized due to its reliability and sufficient capacity to circulate the nutrient solution consistently. This pump operates at {{specifications}}, providing optimal nutrient flow without overwhelming the system or causing plant root damage.

**3. Hoses and Tubing** Flexible and durable hoses, specifically {{hose material type}}, with an inner diameter of {{inner diameter}}, were selected from {{brand}}. These hoses ensure a smooth and constant nutrient solution flow from the reservoir to the plant tray and back, minimizing leaks and blockages. The hose configuration was arranged to facilitate straightforward maintenance and inspection.

**4. Plant Tray (Tube)** The plant tray, constructed as a tube or elongated channel, was crafted from {{material type}}, selected for its resistance to algae growth and ease of cleaning. With dimensions of approximately {{dimensions}}, provided by {{brand}}, the tray was inclined slightly at {{degree}} degrees to allow gravity-driven return of the nutrient solution. This gentle slope is critical in NFT systems, as it creates a shallow nutrient film that efficiently delivers nutrients and oxygen to plant roots.

**5. Net Cups** Net cups, which securely hold the plants in place, were chosen based on their compatibility with the chosen plant species and their optimal dimensions. Cups measuring approximately {{size}} from {{brand}} were used, constructed of {{material type}} for durability and root aeration effectiveness. These cups hold the plant roots suspended within the nutrient film without restricting growth or nutrient uptake.

**Operating Principle and Maintenance** In operation, the pump moves the nutrient solution from the reservoir through the hoses to the upper end of the plant tray, creating a thin film that travels down the inclined tray. The plants, situated in net cups with exposed roots, absorb nutrients directly from this flowing film. The nutrient solution then returns to the reservoir by gravity via a return hose, completing the circulation loop.

Regular maintenance activities involve monitoring and adjusting the nutrient solution pH and electrical conductivity (EC), ensuring hoses and pumps remain unclogged, and routinely inspecting plants for any signs of nutrient deficiencies or pathogens. Proper maintenance ensures sustainable and successful plant cultivation in the NFT hydroponics system.

**Conclusion** This NFT hydroponics system, comprising carefully selected and assembled components, provides a reliable, efficient, and easily maintainable solution for soilless plant cultivation. By optimizing component selection and ensuring routine maintenance, the system effectively promotes robust plant growth with significantly reduced resource usage compared to traditional agriculture.
