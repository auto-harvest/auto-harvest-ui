The wiring and physical integration of components in the Auto Harvest system were designed to support **modular prototyping, easy debugging, and safe power delivery**. While the system is intended for eventual enclosure-based deployment, the current development setup is optimized for **open public demonstration**, educational clarity, and accessibility.

#### ðŸ§© Pin Mapping and Interfaces

All component connections follow the pin mapping shown in Section 3.1. The **MEGA Sensor Shield V2.4** provides labeled breakout headers for analog, digital, and I2C pins, enabling direct plug-and-play wiring via **Dupont connectors** â€” eliminating the need for jumper wires or breadboards.

Standard interface types in use:

- **Digital**: For switches, flow sensors, relay triggers
    
- **Analog**: For sensors like pH and TDS
    
- **I2C**: For the LCD and ESP8266
    
- **Serial (COM1)**: For Wi-Fi module communication
    

#### ðŸ”‹ Power Supply and Distribution

The system is powered through a **12V DC rotary switch power supply**, which feeds into the Sensor Shield. This supply is **split into three branches** to simultaneously power:

- The **Arduino Mega**
    
- The **Water Pump**
    
- The **Air Pump**
    

All power connections are done via direct lines and securely fitted **Dupont connectors**.

To ensure future compatibility with **3.3V-based microcontrollers** like the ESP32, a **step-down voltage regulator** is integrated into the layout. This allows the system to switch to lower voltage logic while keeping the actuator supply stable.

#### ðŸ§  Communication Challenges and Solutions

All three main communication interfaces (analog, digital, I2C) are used simultaneously. During early integration, a few challenges were encountered:

- The **flow sensor (hall effect)** required an **interrupt-capable pin** to measure pulses accurately. Since not all digital pins on the Mega support interrupts, careful pin selection was necessary.
    
- The **I2C pins (D20/D21)** were not explicitly labeled on the board, requiring manual referencing of the Mega's schematic.
    
- The **float sensors** experienced periodic signal instability, which was resolved by enabling **internal pull-up resistors**, stabilizing the logic levels.
    

#### ðŸª› Physical Assembly and Layout

The prototype hardware is mounted on a **hard insulating display board**, arranged to expose each component clearly for **demonstration and educational purposes**. The wires are routed and fastened using:

- **Heat shrink tubing**, to reduce clutter and tangling
    
- **Nail anchors**, to secure modules and shield in place
    

This approach enhances both **visual appeal** and **wire management**, particularly in a public display or prototyping setting.
