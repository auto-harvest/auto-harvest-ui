The Auto Harvest system incorporates a robust sensor suite that enables real-time environmental, chemical, and fluidic monitoring. These sensors provide essential data for maintaining healthy crop conditions in a hydroponic setup, such as pH levels, water temperature, humidity, and flow rate.

Each sensor was selected for its simplicity, availability, and relevance to the project's goals ‚Äî though calibration and signal handling required practical experimentation and tuning beyond typical datasheet expectations.

#### üå°Ô∏è Environmental Monitoring

- **DHT11 ‚Äì Air Temperature & Humidity**
    
    - A simple digital sensor used to track the ambient conditions around the grow area.
        
    - Positioned above the water line to avoid condensation interference.
        
    - Provides two values: relative humidity (%) and temperature (¬∞C).
        
    - Values are filtered in software to remove jitter from occasional faulty reads.
        
- **DS18B20 ‚Äì Water Temperature**
    
    - A waterproof digital sensor using 1-Wire protocol.
        
    - Submerged in the nutrient solution reservoir.
        
    - Provides high-resolution temperature data with low noise and minimal drift.
        
    - Calibrated against a lab thermometer during testing.

#### üíß Liquid and Flow Monitoring

- **Water Flow Sensor (Hall Effect)**
    
    - Measures water circulation rate through a pulse count from a hall sensor.
        
    - Connected to a pin supporting **hardware interrupts** to avoid missed pulses.
        
    - Timing precision is critical; interrupt logic is prioritized in the Arduino sketch.
        
- **Water Level Float Sensors (x2)**
    
    - Simple switches that close on liquid contact.
        
    - Installed in **low** and **high** positions inside the tank.
        
    - Initial testing showed signal noise and oscillation; resolved by enabling **internal pull-up resistors** in code.

#### üß™ Chemical Monitoring

- **SEN0161 ‚Äì pH Sensor (DFROBOT)**
    
    - Analog sensor used to determine the acidity/alkalinity of the solution.
        
    - Initial behavior was **inverted**: acidic solutions read high pH values.
        
    - The provided library was found unreliable. A **custom calibration approach** was adopted:
        
        - Used a **two-point calibration method** (distilled water @ 7.0 pH, acidic test solution @ 4.03 pH).
            
        - Mapped raw millivolt output to accurate pH values via **linear interpolation**.
            
        - Result: reliable output with ¬±0.5 accuracy in target range.
            
- **SEN0244 ‚Äì TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) Sensor**
    
    - Analog sensor for nutrient strength.
        
    - Sensitive to electrical interference; power lines were isolated and shielding used where needed.
        
    - Outputs were compared with commercial TDS meter for baseline validation.

### üîß Calibration and Field Adjustment

To ensure reliability in real-world conditions, sensors are:

- **Calibrated** manually during initial deployment
    
- Supported by **software offsets and scaling factors** configurable via OTA in future versions
    
- Verified using **physical test kits** and **external meters** during development
    

The sensor stack forms the **core feedback loop** for the Auto Harvest system ‚Äî enabling both automated reactions (e.g., pump control) and user-informed decisions via the mobile interface.
