Though Auto Harvest is designed for autonomous operation, regular maintenance is necessary to ensure long-term sensor accuracy, mechanical reliability, and safe operation. The system emphasizes **ease of access, modular replacements, and graceful degradation** when components become faulty or disconnected.

#### üß™ Sensor Lifespan and Replacement Criteria

- The **pH probe** has a limited lifespan and is the most sensitive sensor in the system. If not kept hydrated or stored correctly, it may degrade irreversibly. Replacement is recommended once accuracy drifts beyond ¬±1 pH, even after recalibration.
    
- **TDS (SEN0244)** and **DS18B20** temperature probes are susceptible to **corrosion** if left exposed to air with residual nutrient solution. If calibration no longer yields stable readings within ¬±50 ppm (TDS) or ¬±0.5¬∞C (DS18B20), replacement is recommended.
    
- All probes are **socketed and hot-swappable**. If unplugged, the system identifies them via out-of-bounds readings and automatically ignores the associated input.
    

In the final enclosure design, all sensors and actuators will be connected via **mini Molex connectors**, allowing quick disconnection and replacement without the need for soldering or disassembly.

#### üßº Cleaning Protocols

- **pH Probe**:  
    Cleaned **only with distilled water** to prevent damage. After cleaning, it should be stored in a **4M KCl ion-rich solution** in its cap to maintain membrane saturation and accuracy. Scrubbing or abrasive cleaning is strongly discouraged.
    
- **TDS, Temperature, and Flow Sensors**:  
    Cleaned with **food-safe agents** such as **diluted hydrogen peroxide**, which is effective for removing organic buildup and algae while acting as a disinfectant ([source](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326303371_Hydrogen_Peroxide_for_Insect_and_Algae_Control_in_a_Lettuce_Hydroponic_Environment)). A warm water rinse is recommended afterward to remove any residual peroxide or fertilizer salts.

#### ‚ö° Hardware Reliability and Protection

After more than four months of live testing (including continuous hydrothermometer operation), all hardware components have proven stable with **no observed failures**.

The system includes built-in protections:

- If a **pump is activated but no water flow is detected**, the system triggers a shutdown of both **water and air relays** to prevent hardware damage due to dry operation.
    
- All components operate at **low voltage and low power**, eliminating the need for thermal or overcurrent protection under standard use.

#### üîÑ Reset, Repair, and Updates

- The system does not yet feature a hardware or software-based watchdog/reset routine for re-pairing, but this is a planned improvement.
    
- Firmware updates are currently applied **manually via USB**. Future builds on ESP32 will support **OTA (Over-The-Air) updates**, improving maintainability at scale.

#### üë®‚Äçüåæ User Expectations

Users are expected to:

- Rinse or clean sensors monthly (or as needed)
    
- Recalibrate chemical sensors after cleaning or when values drift
    
- Replace sensors that cannot be recalibrated within expected error margins
    
- Periodically inspect tubing and flow systems for clogs or buildup
    

Instructional support for cleaning and maintenance will be delivered via the **mobile app** in future releases. The onboard LCD will also provide **basic error and status messages** in offline mode.

This modular, socketed hardware and maintenance protocol ensures Auto Harvest remains a low-friction, field-ready system ‚Äî both for casual users and in larger, automated installations.
