**Introduction** Opposed to classic "dumb" hydroponic systems where manual checks need to be performed regularly in order to assess the water, nutrient, environment quality with ph strips, handheld TDS/EC meters, physically looking at the water/air temperature and humidity sensor display, where historic values need to be manually recorded, our solution offers live monitoring and recording in order for the user to have full view of the conditions in the NFT system regardless of his location. Our hardware solution combines water level, temperature, flow, air humidity, temperature, a ph and TDS sensors, water pump, air pump modules and ESP-01 WiFi connected to a ATMEGA2560  microcontroller as an integrated solution
