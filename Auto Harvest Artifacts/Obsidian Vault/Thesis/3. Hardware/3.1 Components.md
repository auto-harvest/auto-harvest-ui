The Auto Harvest system is developed around a modular set of electronic components designed to monitor environmental and chemical parameters while automating fluid and air control processes within a hydroponic setup. The current build uses a **development prototype** centered on an **Arduino Mega 2560** with a **Sensor Shield V2.4**, enabling rapid testing and reconfiguration.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: This hardware configuration is intended for development and testing. In a production-grade deployment, the system would transition to a more compact, energy-efficient design ‚Äî most likely based on an **ESP32** microcontroller, offering **Wi-Fi + Bluetooth**, **higher processing capability**, and **OTA (Over-The-Air) updates**. A **custom PCB** would also be designed to integrate the necessary sensors and connectors, minimizing bulk and increasing durability.
