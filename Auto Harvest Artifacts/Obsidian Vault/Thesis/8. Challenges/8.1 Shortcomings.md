Despite reaching a fully functional state, the system has a few notable limitations:

- **No OTA Updates**: Firmware updates require physical USB access to the microcontroller. This limits scalability and responsiveness, especially when deployed in remote or sealed environments. Migrating to an ESP32 and adopting OTA logic is planned for future versions.
    
- **App-Guided Calibration Not Implemented**: Although calibration is critical for pH and TDS sensors, the process is still manual. A guided UI to assist users in performing 2-point calibration via the app is a key roadmap item.
    
- **Budget and Resource Constraints**: The project was **entirely self-funded**, relying heavily on free-tier cloud services, recycled hardware, and limited sensors. These constraints affected hardware choices, cloud capacity, and development velocity.
    
- **Limited Debugging Capabilities**:
    
    - No hardware debugger or breakpoint support
        
    - No persistent error logs or error codes
        
    - Crashes or sensor faults often result in firmware restarts
        
- **Material and Embedded Experience**: Initially, there was a **knowledge gap** in working with electrical components, calibration theory, and embedded C++. This led to longer debugging cycles and a more monolithic firmware architecture than initially planned.
    
- **Feature Limitations**:
    
    - No **combined graph viewer** to visualize trends across multiple sensor types
        
    - Mobile and web UIs are functional but **lack real-time visual diagnostics**
        
    - **Push notifications are only supported on mobile** â€” the web app lacks a dedicated implementation due to Expo's limitations
