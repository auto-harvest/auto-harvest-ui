Some features and ideas were explored but later abandoned due to complexity, hardware incompatibility, or time limitations:

- **OTA on ATMega/ESP8266**: Attempts to enable over-the-air updates on the original board failed due to memory constraints and unstable bootloader behavior. This led to a hard decision to avoid OTA for now and focus on system stability.
    
- **pH Driver Issues**: The official libraries provided by some manufacturers (like DFRobot) gave inconsistent results. Eventually, a **custom voltage-to-pH interpolation** strategy was adopted, calibrated manually using reference solutions and open-source research.
    
- **Distributed Modular Design Abandoned**: An early architectural idea was to build a **modular sensor network**, where each sensor would include its own microcontroller or logic unit and publish one clean value (e.g., pH, EC, temperature) to a central processing hub via serial or wireless protocols. This would reduce wiring complexity, isolate faults, and enable hot-swapping. However, due to:
    
    - Only having a **single development board**
        
    - Limited budget and time
        
    - Lack of access to enough MCU units
        
    - Inexperience with UART bus design, CAN, or Zigbee protocols at the time  
        ...this approach was abandoned in favor of a centralized monolithic firmware architecture running all sensors off a single controller.
    
- **Graph Library Gaps**: Despite multiple attempts, no shared charting library was found that could render historical sensor data consistently across both **React Native (Android)** and **React Web**. This led to abandoning real-time graph views in the mobile app.
    
- **Expo Notifications (Web)**: The Expo Push Notification system works well for mobile devices but lacks web support. Implementing browser notifications would have required a separate integration (e.g., Firebase Cloud Messaging) which was deprioritized due to time.
