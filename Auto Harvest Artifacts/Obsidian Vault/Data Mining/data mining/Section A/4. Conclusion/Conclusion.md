The **J48 algorithm with SMOTE** stands out due to its superior overall accuracy and Kappa statistic. More importantly for spam filtering, it achieves the **lowest count of False Positives (216)**, tied with Naive Bayes, ensuring minimal legitimate emails are incorrectly flagged as spam. Simultaneously, it maintains a **very high Spam True Positive Rate (0.873)** and a strong F-Measure (0.876), indicating it successfully identifies a large proportion of actual spam. This balanced performance, prioritizing both user experience (low false alarms) and effective spam capture, makes J48 the most suitable algorithm for your assignment's objective.
