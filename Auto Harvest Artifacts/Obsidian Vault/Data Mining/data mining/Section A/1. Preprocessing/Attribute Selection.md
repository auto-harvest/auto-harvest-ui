For the email classification task (spam vs. legitimate email), all available attributes were initially considered for model training. These attributes include: `cap_ave` (average capital letters), `remove` (presence of "remove" or "unsubscribe" terms), `ooo` (presence of "out of office" or "OOO" terms), `money` (presence of "money" terms), `free` (presence of "free" terms), `our` (presence of "our" terms), `char_$` (presence of '$' character), and `char_!` (presence of '!' character).

From a domain perspective, all these attributes are inherently **highly relevant** to the problem of spam detection, as they represent common linguistic and structural characteristics frequently found in unsolicited bulk emails. For instance, `cap_ave`, `char_$`, `char_!`, `money`, and `free` are classic indicators of deceptive or promotional content often associated with spam. Attributes like `remove` and `ooo` can also be exploited by spammers.

The decision to utilize all available attributes was based on their clear conceptual relevance and the expectation that the chosen classification algorithms would either leverage these features effectively or, in the case of J48, intrinsically prioritize the most informative ones. The experimental results, particularly with the J48 decision tree which inherently performs feature selection by constructing its tree based on information gain, suggest that valuable predictive power resides across this set of attributes, validating their inclusion.
