This report details the performance of a **J48 (C4.5 decision tree) classification algorithm** used for email classification (spam vs. emai). As in the previous evaluations, the **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) filter** was applied during training (`weka.filters.supervised.instance.SMOTE -C 0 -K 5 -P 53.79 -S 1`) to address class imbalance. The model was evaluated using **10-fold cross-validation** on 4601 instances with 9 attributes.

### **Key Findings from the Evaluation**

- **Overall Accuracy:** The J48 classifier achieved an impressive **90.28% correct classification rate**, correctly identifying 4154 out of 4601 emails. This marks the highest overall accuracy among the models analyzed so far. The **incorrectly classified instances stood at 9.72%** (447 instances).
- **Kappa Statistic:** With a **Kappa statistic of 0.7963**, this model shows a very strong level of agreement between predictions and actual classes, further indicating excellent reliability.
- **Error Measures:**
    - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 0.1557
    - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** 0.2853 The RMSE is the lowest among the models, suggesting that the J48's predictions are, on average, closer to the true values.

### **Detailed Accuracy by Class**

The J48 algorithm with SMOTE demonstrates strong and balanced performance across both classes:

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|**Metric**|**Spam (Positive Class)**|**Email (Negative Class)**|**Weighted Average**|
|**True Positive Rate (Recall)**|0.873|0.923|0.903|
|**False Positive Rate**|0.077|0.127|0.108|
|**Precision**|0.880|0.918|0.903|
|**F-Measure**|0.876|0.920|0.903|
|**ROC Area**|0.928|0.928|0.928|
|**PRC Area**|0.891|0.923|0.911|

- **"Spam" Classification:**
    - The **recall (True Positive Rate) for spam is 0.873**, indicating that 87.3% of actual spam emails were correctly identified. This is the highest spam recall seen across all models.
    - The **precision for spam is 0.880**. This means 88.0% of emails predicted as spam were truly spam, representing a good balance.
    - The **False Positive Rate for spam is 0.077**, indicating that 7.7% of legitimate emails were incorrectly flagged as spam. This is lower than the IBk model, but still higher than the Naive Bayes models without SMOTE.
- **"Emai" (Legitimate Email) Classification:**
    - The **recall for "emai" is 0.923**, meaning 92.3% of legitimate emails were correctly identified.
    - The **precision for "emai" is 0.918**, indicating that 91.8% of emails predicted as "emai" were truly legitimate.
    - The **False Positive Rate for "emai" is 0.127**, which means 12.7% of actual spam emails were incorrectly classified as "emai" (missed spam). This is a very good result, indicating few spam emails are slipping through.
- **Overall Balance:** The F-Measure for both classes is high (0.876 for spam, 0.920 for emai), showcasing a robust and balanced performance.
- **ROC and PRC Areas:** The **ROC Area of 0.928** is strong, indicating good discrimination. The **PRC Area of 0.891 for spam and 0.923 for emai** also reflects solid performance, particularly important for imbalanced datasets.

### **Confusion Matrix**

The confusion matrix provides a direct count of classifications:

|                  |                    |                     |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- |
|                  | **Predicted Spam** | **Predicted Email** |
| **Actual Spam**  | 1582               | 231                 |
| **Actual Email** | 216                | 2572                |

- **True Positives (Spam):** **1582** spam emails were correctly identified as spam. This is the **highest number of correctly identified spam** emails across all presented models.
- **False Negatives (Spam):** **231** actual spam emails were incorrectly classified as legitimate ("emai"). This represents the **lowest number of missed spam emails** among all evaluated models.
- **False Positives (Spam):** **216** actual legitimate emails were incorrectly classified as spam. While lower than the IBk model, this is still higher than the Naive Bayes models, implying more legitimate emails might end up in the spam folder compared to Naive Bayes.
- **True Negatives (Spam):** **2572** actual legitimate emails were correctly identified as legitimate.

### **Summary**

The **J48 decision tree algorithm with SMOTE** demonstrates **excellent overall performance** for spam classification, achieving the highest accuracy and Kappa statistic among the evaluated models. It excels particularly in **identifying the maximum amount of spam (highest recall for spam)** while simultaneously having the **lowest number of missed spam emails (false negatives)**. The trade-off is a moderate number of false positives (legitimate emails incorrectly marked as spam) compared to the Naive Bayes models, though still a significant improvement over the IBk model.

This model strikes a very good balance between catching spam and minimizing legitimate email misclassifications, making it a strong candidate for practical spam filtering applications.
