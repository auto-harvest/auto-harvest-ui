This report details the performance of a **Random Forest classification algorithm** used for email classification (spam vs. legitimate email). As with the previous runs, the **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) filter** was applied during the training phase (`weka.filters.supervised.instance.SMOTE -C 0 -K 5 -P 53.79 -S 1`) to help balance the class distribution. The model's performance was evaluated using **10-fold cross-validation** on 4601 instances, utilizing the same 9 attributes.

### **Key Findings from the Evaluation**

- **Overall Accuracy:** The Random Forest classifier achieved an **88.20% correct classification rate**, correctly identifying 4058 out of 4601 emails. This is a very strong result, competitive with the best performing models so far. The **incorrectly classified instances were 11.80%** (543 instances).
- **Kappa Statistic:** A **Kappa statistic of 0.7549** indicates a strong level of agreement beyond chance, suggesting good reliability and consistency in the model's predictions.
- **Error Measures:**
    - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 0.1356
    - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** 0.3024 Both error metrics are low, indicating that the model's predictions are generally close to the actual values.

### **Detailed Accuracy by Class**

The Random Forest algorithm with SMOTE shows robust and well-balanced performance across both "spam" and "emai" classes:

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|**Metric**|**Spam (Positive Class)**|**Email (Negative Class)**|**Weighted Average**|
|**True Positive Rate (Recall)**|0.874|0.887|0.882|
|**False Positive Rate**|0.113|0.126|0.121|
|**Precision**|0.834|0.916|0.884|
|**F-Measure**|0.854|0.901|0.882|
|**ROC Area**|0.936|0.936|0.936|
|**PRC Area**|0.915|0.937|0.928|

- **"Spam" Classification:**
    - The **recall (True Positive Rate) for spam is 0.874**, meaning 87.4% of actual spam emails were correctly identified. This is a very high recall rate for spam, indicating strong effectiveness in catching unwanted emails.
    - The **precision for spam is 0.834**. This means that 83.4% of emails predicted as spam were indeed spam.
    - The **False Positive Rate for spam is 0.113**, implying that 11.3% of legitimate emails were incorrectly flagged as spam. This is a consideration for user experience, as it represents false alarms.
- **"Emai" (Legitimate Email) Classification:**
    - The **recall for "emai" is 0.887**, indicating that 88.7% of legitimate emails were correctly identified.
    - The **precision for "emai" is 0.916**, meaning 91.6% of emails predicted as "emai" were truly legitimate.
    - The **False Positive Rate for "emai" is 0.126**, which implies that 12.6% of actual spam emails were incorrectly classified as "emai" (missed spam).
- **Overall Balance:** The F-Measure scores are strong for both classes (0.854 for spam, 0.901 for emai), reflecting a good balance between precision and recall.
- **ROC and PRC Areas:** The **ROC Area of 0.936** for both classes is excellent, indicating very strong discriminatory power. The **PRC Area of 0.915 for spam and 0.937 for emai** also highlights robust performance, particularly valuable for handling class imbalance.

### **Confusion Matrix**

The confusion matrix provides the direct counts of classifications:

|                  |                    |                     |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- |
|                  | **Predicted Spam** | **Predicted Email** |
| **Actual Spam**  | 1585               | 228                 |
| **Actual Email** | 315                | 2473                |

- **True Positives (Spam):** **1585** spam emails were correctly identified as spam. This is the highest number of correctly identified spam emails among all models examined.
- **False Negatives (Spam):** **228** actual spam emails were incorrectly classified as legitimate ("emai"). This represents the lowest number of missed spam emails so far.
- **False Positives (Spam):** **315** actual legitimate emails were incorrectly classified as spam. This is a moderate number of false alarms, higher than Naive Bayes but lower than IBk.
- **True Negatives (Spam):** **2473** actual legitimate emails were correctly identified as legitimate.

### **Summary**

The **Random Forest algorithm, when combined with SMOTE**, delivers **outstanding overall performance** for spam classification. It achieves one of the highest overall accuracies and a very strong Kappa statistic.

Crucially, it demonstrates **excellent recall for spam (87.4%)**, resulting in the **fewest missed spam emails** (228 False Negatives) among all tested models. While it does produce a moderate number of false positives (315 legitimate emails incorrectly marked as spam) which is a consideration for user experience, its overall balance between catching spam and correctly identifying legitimate emails, coupled with its high ROC and PRC areas, makes it a **highly effective and robust choice** for this spam detection task.
