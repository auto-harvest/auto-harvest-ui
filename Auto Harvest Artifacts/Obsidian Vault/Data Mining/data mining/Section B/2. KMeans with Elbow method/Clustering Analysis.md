A**Algorithm and Parameter Selection:**

The **K-Means clustering algorithm** was applied to the "StudentsPerformance" dataset. To determine the optimal number of clusters (K), the **Elbow Method** was employed. This method involved analyzing the **within-cluster sum of squared errors (SSE)** for varying numbers of clusters. As demonstrated by the SSE values (2185.71 for K=2, 1865.86 for K=3, 1768.29 for K=4, etc.), a significant drop in SSE was observed from K=2 to K=3. While further increases in K continued to decrease the SSE, the rate of decrease became progressively smaller, indicating an "elbow" point around K=3 or K=4. Based on this inflection point, and to balance model complexity with cluster meaningfulness, **K was set to 3 (-N 3)** for this run.

The **Euclidean Distance** metric was utilized to quantify similarity between instances, considering all attributes, with a maximum of 500 iterations for convergence. Prior to clustering, categorical attributes such as `gender`, `race/ethnicity`, `parental level of education`, `lunch`, and `test preparation course`, were pre-processed using a **NominalToBinary filter**. This conversion assigns numerical values (0 or 1) to each distinct category, enabling their inclusion in distance-based calculations alongside the inherent numerical scores (`math score`, `reading score`, `writing score`).

**Clustering Results and Interpretation:**

The algorithm successfully converged in 7 iterations with the chosen K=3, yielding a **Within Cluster Sum of Squared Errors (WSSSE) of 1865.86**, confirming the compactness of the formed clusters. The 1000 student instances were effectively partitioned into three distinct groups:

- **Cluster 0:** Comprising 262 students (26% of the dataset).
- **Cluster 1:** Containing 319 students (32% of the dataset).
- **Cluster 2:** The largest cluster, with 419 students (42% of the dataset).

**Analysis of Cluster Characteristics:**

By examining the final cluster centroids, distinct patterns emerge, primarily driven by `race/ethnicity` attributes:

- **Cluster 0: "Group D - High Achievers"**
    
    - This cluster is strongly characterized by students primarily from **"race/ethnicity=group D"**.
    - Academically, students in this group show **slightly above-average performance**, particularly in writing, with mean scores of Math: 67.36, Reading: 70.03, and Writing: 70.15.
    - Other demographic attributes like gender, parental education, and lunch status are broadly reflective of the overall dataset's proportions.
- **Cluster 1: "Group C - Average Math, Higher Reading/Writing"**
    
    - This cluster is predominantly defined by students from **"race/ethnicity=group C"**.
    - Their average **math score (64.46) is slightly below the dataset's overall average**, while reading (69.10) and writing (67.83) scores are closer to or slightly above average.
    - Gender distribution and other demographic factors are generally consistent with the full dataset.
- **Cluster 2: "Mixed Backgrounds - Average Performers"**
    
    - This is the most diverse cluster in terms of ethnicity, primarily encompassing students from **"race/ethnicity=group B", "group A", and "group E"**.
    - Academically, students in this cluster exhibit **scores that closely align with the overall average performance** across all three subjects (Math: 66.53, Reading: 68.68, Writing: 66.92).
    - Demographic distributions for gender, parental education, and lunch status are also largely consistent with the full dataset's proportions.

**Concluding Remarks:**

The K-Means clustering, with K=3 as determined by the Elbow Method, successfully segmented the student population primarily based on their **racial/ethnic backgrounds**, revealing that these groupings correlate with subtle but observable differences in academic performance patterns. Cluster 0 (Group D) showed slightly higher performance, Cluster 1 (Group C) had slightly lower math scores, and Cluster 2 (mixed groups A, B, E) represented the overall average.

The insights gained from this clustering could inform further investigation into these underlying factors to develop targeted support and policies aimed at **achieving more equitable educational outcomes for all students.**
